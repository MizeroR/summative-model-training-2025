## üéØ Project Overview

This notebook demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline that:

1. **Compares traditional ML and deep learning approaches** for image classification
2. **Implements 7 different models** across both paradigms
3. **Conducts comprehensive experiments** with proper train/validation/test splits
4. **Analyzes results** including per-class performance, confusion patterns, and model confidence
5. **Provides actionable insights** into dataset limitations and recommendations

## üß™ Models Implemented

### Traditional Machine Learning (Scikit-learn)
Uses pre-trained MobileNetV2 for feature extraction:
1. **Random Forest Classifier** - Ensemble of 200 decision trees
2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** - RBF kernel with optimized parameters
3. **Gradient Boosting Classifier** - Sequential ensemble learning

### Deep Learning (TensorFlow)

#### Sequential API
4. **Simple CNN from Scratch** - Custom 3-block convolutional architecture
5. **MobileNetV2 Transfer Learning** - Pre-trained on ImageNet, frozen base

#### Functional API
6. **Multi-Branch CNN** - Parallel 3x3 and 5x5 convolutional paths
7. **EfficientNetB0 with Fine-tuning** - Two-phase training with layer unfreezing

## üöÄ Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Automated dataset downloading** from UCI Machine Learning Repository
- ‚úÖ **Data augmentation** (rotation, shifts, zoom, flips) for improved generalization
- ‚úÖ **Stratified train/validation/test split** (70/15/15) maintaining class distribution
- ‚úÖ **tf.data API** integration via ImageDataGenerator
- ‚úÖ **Callbacks**: Early stopping, learning rate reduction
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive visualizations**: 15+ plots including confusion matrices, training histories, per-class metrics
- ‚úÖ **Error analysis**: Misclassification patterns and model confidence analysis
- ‚úÖ **Class imbalance handling**: Detection and recommendations
- ‚úÖ **Production-ready outputs**: Saved models and results for deployment

## üìä Results Summary

| Model Type | Best Model | Test Accuracy |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| Traditional ML | Random Forest | ~65% |
| Deep Learning | EfficientNetB0 | ~80-90% |

**Key Finding:** Deep learning models significantly outperform traditional ML approaches, demonstrating the importance of end-to-end feature learning for complex visual classification tasks in authentic landfill environments.

## üîç Key Insights

1. **Class Imbalance (2.90x ratio)**: The dataset reflects real-world waste distribution with plastic being most common
2. **Transfer Learning Effectiveness**: Pre-trained models improve accuracy by ~15-20% over CNNs from scratch
3. **Challenging Categories**: Textile Trash and Food Organics show lower F1-scores due to limited samples and visual similarity
4. **Landfill Environment Challenges**: Variable lighting, occlusion, and contamination make classification inherently difficult
5. **Model Confidence**: Low-confidence predictions (<0.5) should undergo human verification in production

## üìÅ Output Files

The notebook generates the following outputs in `/kaggle/working/` or your local directory:

- `model_comparison_results.csv` - Performance metrics for all 7 models
- `per_class_performance.csv` - Precision, recall, F1-score per waste category
- `confusion_patterns.csv` - Top misclassification patterns

### Model Limitations
- Trained on Australian landfill waste - may not generalize to other regions
- Class imbalance may cause bias toward common categories (Plastic, Metal)
- Real-world deployment requires confidence thresholding and human verification
- Model size (~100-300MB) may require optimization for edge deployment

## üîß Customization

```

### Modify Training Parameters
```python
BATCH_SIZE = 16  # Adjust based on GPU memory
